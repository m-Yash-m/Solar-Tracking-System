# Solar-Tracking-System

The Solar Tracking System is an innovative project that aims to increase the efficiency of solar panels by optimizing their orientation towards the sun. The system consists of a set of sensors, actuators, and a microcontroller that work together to adjust the angle and position of the solar panel based on the position of the sun.The project is suitable for use in both residential and commercial applications, such as powering homes, schools, and offices. It is environmentally friendly and can help reduce the carbon footprint by harnessing the power of the sun.

# Introduction
Solar energy has become a popular alternative to traditional sources of energy due to its environmental and economic benefits. However, the efficiency of solar panels depends on the amount of sunlight they receive, which varies throughout the day and year. One way to optimize the efficiency of solar panels is to use a solar tracking system. A solar tracking system is designed to follow the movement of the sun throughout the day, ensuring that the solar panels are always positioned at the optimal angle for maximum energy production.

This project aims to design and build a solar tracking system using basic electronic components and an Arduino microcontroller. The solar tracking system will be able to track the sun's movement and adjust the angle of the solar panel to maximize energy production.

The project will consist of three main components: hardware, software, and data analysis. The hardware will include the solar panel, a servo motor, two LDR sensors, a 10k resistor, jumper wires, and a foam board/cardboard. The software will consist of code written in Arduino programming language, which will control the movement of the servo motor based on the readings from the LDR sensors. The data analysis will involve collecting and analyzing data on the performance of the solar tracking system, including energy production, efficiency, and other relevant metrics.

The solar tracking system has several advantages over fixed solar panels. First, it increases energy production by up to 40% compared to fixed solar panels. This means that the solar tracking system can generate more electricity, which can save money on energy bills and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Second, it can improve the lifespan of solar panels by reducing the temperature of the panels, which can reduce wear and tear on the panels. Third, it can be used in a wide range of applications, including residential, commercial, and industrial settings.

Overall, this project aims to demonstrate the potential benefits of solar tracking systems and provide a low-cost, DIY solution for anyone interested in improving the efficiency of their solar panels. By building and testing a solar tracking system, we can gain valuable insights into the performance and limitations of these systems and contribute to the growing field of renewable energy.
